#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	char character = 'X';
	int integer = character;
	cout << character << " " << static_cast<int>(character);
	cout << " " << integer << " " << static_cast<char>(integer);
}
output is:

X 88 88 X

explain:

Weâ€™ll discuss the conversions later, but for now we only want 
to mention that a phrase written as:

static_cast<newtype>(expr)

changes the type of the expr expression into the newtype type.

What it means is that we can see the ASCII code of any character
 stored within a char variable and vice versa, or see a character 
whose ASCII code is placed inside an int variable.
